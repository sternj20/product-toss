Welcome! You have reached the in progress development of a mobile application called Product Toss. Product Toss provides users opportunities to connect, design and compete.

The application offers these components:

Design competitions for users to compete in
A PicWheel to spin and discover
Prizes to win
Artwork galleries to view and vote upon
A place for users to connect with friends, followers and others they find inspiring
Upon logging in for the first time you can immediately be consumed with amazing submissions from the past weeks of competition. These submissions are intricate and creative masterpieces from all around the world all tied together by a shared theme: Deep Sea could be the theme one week and Pluto the next.

We believe in continuous integration based on user needs and wants. The application has an open and fresh design with much opportunity to evolve from where it is now.

Thank you for taking a look.
